Description

My goal with this project was to improve the codebase for the website given, to meet accessibility standards and improve SEO. 

No visible changes were done to the website, the changes were in the code itself. This was done to make the code easier to read and load faster, making it more accessible in search engines.

The code had multiple div elements in the HTML file, so I replaced them with the 
proper HTML semantics. 

The CSS had many redundancies as well, which were fixed. I grouped together the last section of the HTML and all of the articles inside were wrapped together in CSS.

I also added comments throughout the HTML and CSS to make divide into 2-3 sections of where changes occurred.
